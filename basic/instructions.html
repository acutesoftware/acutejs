<h1>Easy Programming</h1>
This page gives you a basic introduction to programming

Using this simple collection of functions you can make an interactive webpage and even a simple game.
<BR>
<BR>

There are explanations on what each thing does 

<h2>Exercise 1 - create a simple web page</h2>
<H3>Copy the templates</H3>
copy the files "index.html", "basic.css" and 
"basic.js" to a new folder in your documents folder

<H3>Make a Javascript program say Hello World</H3>

Create a new text file in your documents folder called "myprogram.js" and paste in the text below
<pre>
        print("Hello World")
     
</pre>

Save the file and double click the "index.html"
<BR>
You should see a green screen with some text saying
<PRE>
        Welcome to your program! 
        Hello World 
</PRE>    


<h2>Exercise 2 - Introducing the canvas</h2>

In your myprogram.js add the following lines at the end of the program 

<PRE>
        border("green", "blue")

        happyFace(100,100, 75)
        normalFace(300,100, 50)
        sadFace(500,100, 30)
        
</PRE>

The first line colors the canvas green and puts a blue border around it<BR>

    The next lines draw faces on the canvas - the numbers there are parameters and they mean the following
<PRE>
    happyFace(X,Y, SIZE)
</PRE>
Where X = how many pixels on the screen from the left <BR>
Y = how many pixels on the screen from the top<BR>
SIZE = how big the face is<BR>

<BR>
    You should see a screen like below <BR>
        <img src="basic_javascript_ex2.png"/>



<h2>Exercise 3 - Adding your own functions</h2>
On the top left of the above screenshot, you will also see 3 buttons<BR>
 <PRE>
    Start refreshes myprogram.js
    Button1 runs myFunction1()
    Button2 runs myFunction2()    
</PRE>  

A function is a little bit of code that runs when something happens (like press a button or click the mouse)
<BR><BR>
When the buttons are clicked they will "run" the functions named myFunction1 and myFunction2 depending on which button you press.

We need to create the functions for buttons 1 and 2.<BR>

    In your myprogram.js you need to add the following code at the end of the file<BR>


        <pre>
    function myFunction1() {
        print('you pressed button 1')
        // you can add more code here that runs when button 1 is pressed
    
        event.preventDefault()
    }
    
    function myFunction2() {
        print('you pressed button 2')
        // you can add more code here that runs when button 2 is pressed
    
        event.preventDefault()
    }


</pre>

        Now refresh the index.html page (in your browser, press [CTRL] [F5]) and you will see in the logs
        <PRE>
                Welcome to your program! 
                Hello World
                you pressed button 1
                you pressed button 2            
        </PRE>



<h2>Exercise 4 - Digging into the Library</h2>
Now that you have built a basic page, you can explore how it all works<BR>


- open the basic.js file to see what the functions do.<BR>
- check out the syntax of javascript [ADD LINK]<BR>
